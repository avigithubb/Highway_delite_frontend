# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Welcome to the repository. This is the frontend for Highway delite assignment.

- It consists four main endpoints namely /, /details, /checkout, /result and an additional /listing.
- /- This is basically the home route to show all the experiences.
- /detail- This fetches the details of the particular experience you want to book.
- /checkout- This is where you place your order.
- /result- The confirmation page.
- /listing- A simple form to add experiences to database.

## How it works:

- It uses React's useState and useEffect to manage and maintain and store the outcomes of the elements like form data and basic checkpoints.
- useEffect whereas used to fetch the APIs from backend and navigate to next page.
- I have use AuthContext API provided by react to maintain the state of the important variable troughout the website so that I can keep track of the records of booking to feed to database.
- Used BrowserRouter to set Routes for different endpoints.

## How to set up in local environment:

** clone the repository.
```
git clone <repository-url>
```
** cd into the folder.
```
cd highway_delite_frontend
```
** Install dependencies.
```
npm install
```
** Run the project.
```
npm run dev
```

Make sure to remove the base url from BrowserRouter, vite.config and package.json unless you want it to run with default endpoint ðŸ˜Š.
